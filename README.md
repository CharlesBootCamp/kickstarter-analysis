# kickstarter-analysis
Challenge 1 working with the Kickstarter Challenge to create varying line charts of the data
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 Using the already given data, I created charts that display how the Kickstarter data gets used based on the goals of the Kickstarters and the launch dates.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare multiple Kickstarter campaigns based on both their launch date and their finance goals, as well as whether or not they were able to accomplish said goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
